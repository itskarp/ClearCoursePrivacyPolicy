    <h1>ClearCourse Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when using the ClearCourse Chrome extension. We value your privacy and are committed to ensuring that your data is handled transparently and securely. The ClearCourse extension does not collect personally identifiable information. The extension processes course data from DegreeWorks to generate academic recommendations. This data is collected locally on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sent to OpenAI</h2>

The data sent to OpenAI is used solely to generate academic insights and is not used for any other purposes.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>No data is stored on our servers. All data related to your course progress and recommendations is processed locally on your device, and any interactions with OpenAI are temporary and occur in real-time. The ClearCourse extension does not retain or store data after processing.</p>

    <h2>No External Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your data with third parties. The data sent to OpenAI for processing is only used for generating recommendations based on your course information, and no personal information is stored or transferred.</p>
